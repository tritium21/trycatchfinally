Try-Catch-Finally
=================


One day in #python, someone made the assertion that the behavior of nested
``try...catch...finally`` structures in the JVM was vastly different than
nested ``try...except...finally`` structures do in Python.  Their specific
complaint was about the order that ``finally`` blocks were executed.  This repo
exists to demonstrate these structures in as many languages as possible.
